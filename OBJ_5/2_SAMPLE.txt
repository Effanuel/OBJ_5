In most languages that use the Latin alphabet,
and in the International Phonetic Alphabet, ⟨d⟩
generally represents the voiced alveolar or 
voiced dental plosive /d/. However, in the Vietnamese 
alphabet, it represents the sound /z/ in
northern dialects or /j/ in southern dialects.
(See D with stroke and Dz (digraph).) In Fijian 
it represents a prenasalized stop /nd/.[2] In
some languages where voiceless unaspirated
stops contrast with https://www.dadsad.comvoiceless aspirated stops,
⟨d⟩ represents an unaspirated /t/, while ⟨t⟩ 
represents an aspirated /tʰ/. Examples of such
languages include Icelandic, Scottish Gaelic, Navajo and 
the Pinyin transliteration of Mandarin.
